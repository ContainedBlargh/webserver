# WEBSERVER - THE APACHE KILLER

Jokes aside, I needed a webserver that specifically could:

1. Host files.
2. Proxy requests to other places.

So I wrote this in `deno` + `oak` to do exactly these two things, rather than try to setup Apache/nginx for the billionth time.

The performance is probably not good enough for thousands, but I'm only using it to host a dedicated site for a couple of friends.
